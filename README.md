# Kok Hong's dotfiles

## Installation

Firstly, clone the repository to `~/dotfiles`

```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:khsoh/dotfiles.git ~
```

Next, we source the `bootstrap.sh`.  This is a shell script that was designed to run on MacOS bash - but can also be executed on Homebrew bash.  It will automatically install Homebrew and other relevant packages.

```
source ~/dotfiles/bootstrap.sh
```
